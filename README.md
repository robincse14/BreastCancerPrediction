This is the most basic machine learning classificaton problem . Project is developed in order to gain insight of classifcation algorithms.

Neural Network , SVM ,Logistic regressing and DEcision TRee algorithms for classification are implemented in this project.

Optimization algorithms for Logistic regression used is Gradient descent , For SVM - SMO algorithm.

Training Dataset is in dataset.txt file and contains 5 attributes and a corresponding classification class for that example.
